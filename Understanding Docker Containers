Introduction to containers

-> Container use the concept of Docker and Docker containers are very light weight because they have the minimal operating system(base operating sysyem) that means they have a base image and whenever they require dependencies , they will take them from the base operating system

-> Dockers are package of Application libraries and system dependencies and for example if one vm is running on linux and if other needs other o.s., docker will take the help of base operating system .

-> Docker basically runs on a bare metal or a physical srver on a virtual machine , and it consumes the resources from the host operating system other than the minimalistic dependencies that it has inside the container and it has the source code and system dependencies in itself but if an application requires some information like it has to consume something from the kernel and if it has to do some system calls, only that things it will do from the host operating system . 

-> Dockers containers are easy to ship from one place to other place that means it can ship from one place and deploy on kubernetes cluster .

-> Docker Life Cycle 
-->Docker File ->(Execute the file and convert in to Docker Image) Docker Image ->(and convert this docker image to) Docker Container 

-> Docker have the Docker Engine where files and images will be submitted to it . 

-> Dockers have disadvantage because it depends on Docker Engine and for suppose this Docker Engine gets down , We lost the containers and Images , so to get this right we have the concept like "Buildah" tool which will take the responsibility of Docker containers by writing commands in shell scripting and that will create a Docker Image. 

-> Buildah tool will solve the Single Point Of Failure problem and Docker Layers problem and it works well with scopio and podman .  


Doubt : not getting image in laptop but getting in CLI 





Real time - 


1) CLI - EC2 AWS - Dev - Git - sourcecode - clone -  container code in Docker - for example - error - rereturn - Dev - Once back - Code - container code and scripts - Jenkins - Orch - Kubernetes Cluster 

Application - Java Application code - www.facebook.com - Java+DB -> Buildtools - Like Maven, Sonar , Gradl 

Generation of .war, .rar files - Docker script

 In Real Time - we need approvals for Git, Jenkins and even to folders 


Interview - CI/CD - CD - 2 types , Diff b/w Continuous Development and Continuous Delivery
